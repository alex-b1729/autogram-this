# Autogram This

A program that searches for and validates [autograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autogram), for example:

> This example autogram has nine o's, two f's, seventeen t's, three m's, thirty-one s's, three y's, seven h's, seven i's, seven w's, two p's, six a's, two d's, seven v's, two l's, three u's, seven r's, two g's, twenty-nine e's, sixteen n's, and four x's.




From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autogram):
> An autogram is a sentence that describes itself in the sense of providing an inventory of its own characters.

### Python module
```python
from autogramthis import Autogram

ag = Autogram("This sentence contains")
autogram = ag.search()
print(autogram)
```

## Capabilities
### Add a suffix to the autogram
The `-s` option sets the `suffix` and the `--no-and` flag removes the 'and' from before the last letter count.
```commandline
python3 -m autogramthis "Spam, Spam, Spam" -s "eggs, and Spam." --no-and
```
> `Spam, Spam, Spam, six a's, two d's, twenty e's, seven f's, four g's, five h's, ten i's, two l's, five m's, seven n's, six o's, five p's, six r's, thirty-one s's, twelve t's, three u's, eight v's, five w's, four x's, three y's, eggs, and Spam.`

### Include punctuation
The script can search for and validate autograms that include the count of the characters `,-'.!`.
In the sentence their full names are written as 'comma', 'hyphen', 'apostrophe', 'period'.
The exception is the exclamation point (`!`) which is written as '!' since that's how it's used in
[Lee Sallow's autogram](https://web.archive.org/web/20130926213111/http://www.fatrazie.com/EWpangram.html) in 
Hofstadter's 1982 "Metamagical Themas" column in Scientific American. 

```commandline
python3 -m autogramthis 'An autogram with punctuation includes' --include-punctuation
```
> `An autogram with punctuation includes eight a's, four c's, four d's, thirty-three e's, ten f's, six g's, twelve h's, eighteen i's, four l's, four m's, nineteen n's, sixteen o's, six p's, fourteen r's, thirty-two s's, twenty-eight t's, twelve u's, six v's, eight w's, five x's, seven y's, twenty-four comma's, five hyphen's, twenty-four apostrophe's, and one period.`

```commandline
python3 -m autogramthis --include-punctuation --validate "Only the fool would take trouble to verify that his 
sentence was composed of ten a's, three b's, four c's, four d's, forty-six e's, sixteen f's, four g's, 
thirteen h's, fifteen i's, two k's, nine l's, four m's, twenty-five n's, twenty-four o's, five p's, 
sixteen r's, forty-one s's, thirty-seven t's, ten u's, eight v's, eight w's, four x's, eleven y's, 
twenty-seven commas, twenty-three apostrophes, seven hyphens and, last but not least, a single \!"
```
```commandline
Valid autogram!
```

### Find a *reflexicon*
A *reflexicon* is a self-enumerating list of words.
Simply calling the script without passing the `prefix` argument or assigning a `suffix` will cause it to search for a list of cardinal number names and characters.
The script starts iterating from a sentence in the form `, one {random.choice(string.ascii_lowercase)}`. 
Finding these can take a while!
```commandline
python3 -m autogramthis --make-singular --no-and
```
> `twenty e, four f, one g, five h, three i, one l, ten n, seven o, seven r, three s, nine t, three u, four v, three w, one x, two y`

### Find a *pangram*
A *pangram* is a sentence that uses every letter of the alphabet. 
Use the `-p` or `--pangram` flag in the command line. 
```commandline
python3 -m autogramthis "The quick brown fox jumped over alphabet soup containing" --pangram
```
> `The quick brown fox jumped over alphabet soup containing five a's, three b's, three c's, three d's, thirty-two e's, six f's, two g's, ten h's, twelve i's, two j's, two k's, three l's, two m's, sixteen n's, sixteen o's, four p's, two q's, thirteen r's, thirty-four s's, twenty-seven t's, seven u's, seven v's, ten w's, six x's, four y's, and one z.`

__Note__ that pangrams with punctuation included will not force include additional characters but will still count
the ones that occur. 


### Validation
Validate if a string is an autogram using `--validate "<sentence to validate>"` in the command line or 
using the `Autogram.validate(sentence: str)` function. 
The `-v` command line flag sets validation output to verbose.

```commandline
$ python3 -m autogramthis --validate "twenty e, four f, one g, five h, three i, one l, ten n, seven o, seven r, three s, nine t, three u, four v, three w, one x, three y"
e: INVALID. True count: 22, Sentence says: 20.
h: INVALID. True count: 6, Sentence says: 5.
o: INVALID. True count: 6, Sentence says: 7.
r: INVALID. True count: 8, Sentence says: 7.
w: INVALID. True count: 2, Sentence says: 3.
y: INVALID. True count: 2, Sentence says: 3.
Invalid!
```

### `Autogram` class
__Parameters__
- `prefix : str` (optional) The string to start the autogram.
- `suffix : str` (optional) The string that ends the autogram.

__Properties__
- `sentence : str` A sentence generated using the current `counts` mapping.
- `is_autogram : bool` True if `sentence` is an autogram.

__Attributes__
- `counts : dict[str, int]` Maps lower case letters and chars to their count in the current sentence.
  Only includes characters with count > 0.
- `make_plural : bool` If True, appends a 's to the end of characters with count greater than 1. (default True)
- `include_final_and : bool` If True, add the word 'and' before the last character count. (default True)
- `is_pangram : bool`  If True, search for autograms where all letters of the alphabet are included. (default False)
- `epoch : int` The number of sentences tried during search.
- `update_all_counts : bool` If True, update all character counts on next epoch, 
  otherwise update one, random character's count.

__Methods__
- `init_counts()`: Sets the `count` attribute to the character counts in `prefix + suffix`.
- `counts_as_phrases(counts: dict) -> list`: 
  Takes a mapping between characters to counts and outputs these counts as a comma 
  delimited list with cardinal number names.
- `count_occurrences(s: str) -> dict`: Take a string and returns a mapping from lowercase chars 
  to their count in the sentence.
- `update_counts()`:
  Updates the `counts` dictionary by alternatively updating all characters or one random character
  as determined by the `update_all_counts` attribute.
- `search() -> str`:
  Repeatedly applies `update_counts()` until an autogram is found.
  Prints to stdout the initial sentence, the number of epochs (updated every 10,000),
  the time taken, the dictionary of character to counts in the final solution, and the autogram.
  Returns the autogram. 

__Static Methods__
- `validate(sentence: str) -> bool`: 
  Returns True if given sentence is an autogram.
  Only works for sentences with individual character counts < 100.
- `find_counts_and_chars(sentence: str) -> list[tuple[str, str]]`:
  Regex searches for number words followed by single character, potentially followed by 's. 
  Returns a list of tuples in the format ('number words', 'character').
